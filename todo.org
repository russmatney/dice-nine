that's the quick game
** level 1 - we're a zero
need to dodge the ones and get the ~sparkly 1~

you're side `one`
can shoot `ones`
rolling returns to 1
can only hit other `ones`

or do you lose the side you're showing when hit?

** level 2 -
* [ ] reveal instructions in order, after the upgrade was collected
* [ ] HUD showing health (number of hearts?)
* [ ] HUD showing unlocked sides
* [ ] enemies don't shoot a `none` dice
* [ ] add a laugh track when you die/get hurt?
* [ ] add pause menu/controls, jazz music
* [ ] shiny-glowy-directions to off/onscreen upgrade
* [ ] progression - rest of the upgrades
